        comments: "Immgrasure has a great team of people who has a lot of knowledge about the educational system in the UK. When I was thinking of doing my masters, they gave me advise to choose the best course to suit my career preferences. I found my passion for healthcare management and clinical governess and chose that as my course of study. Although I am only about to finish my courses, Immigrasure team are already helped me with job finding in the UK. This only happened because of the field of study, which is relevant in the current environment. I also find the team to very kind, helpful and always has their door open if you want to talk about any concerns or questions.",

They gave me interview preparedness which was big reliever. I had some issues with the visa process and Immigrasure team helped to get through it by expert advise and being accessible when you have a query. Their services extended even after I arrived in the Uk.They gave me lot of support in setting my life in the UK. I was very anxious about living in the Uk especially getting my traditional food :). They connected me with a local faith group and association. Now I have a lot of friends in the Uk now!',

After passing my OET , they helped me with CBT-NMC and OSCE. They found an appropriate job for me in the Uk as well. It is a one stop shot for finding employment abroad. The platform also helped me to understand different process in the UK such as getting a drivers licence. It is still a go to if I am in doubt about anything because of their massive knowledge library.",

        comments: "I am a radiologist, recently found work in the Uk. Immigrasure helped me with the process. I had to bring the family with me. It was very stressful as I had two small children. Alongside with the help for my employment, they supported me to find a house in the UK. They had a personal touch to their services and helped to alleviate anxiety and focus on my Jon when I started.",
