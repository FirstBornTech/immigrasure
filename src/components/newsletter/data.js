        desc: "The Nursing and Midwifery Council is asking its council to approve a public consultation on amending English language requirements for internationally trained applicants, to ensure the processes are 'fair and reliable'. \n This request comes after concerns that have been raised about the current requirements, as well as the increasing number of successful appeals by applicants to the NMC's registration appeals panel. \n The NMC argues that this shows that 'there may be a case for change'. \nAt present, internationally trained nurses must demonstrate 'a knowledge of English which is necessary for safe and effective practice of nursing, midwifery in the UK or as a nursing associate in England.'"
